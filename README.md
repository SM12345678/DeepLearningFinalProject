# DeepLearningFinalProject
Large images pose a problem for the conventional object detection techniques. Object detection techniques like R-CNN, SSD are
computationally extensive. They also incur heavy memory and runtime costs for large or densely populated images. This project aims
at improving the conventional R-CNN and SSD algorithms using Reinforcement Learning. Using a Reinforcement Learning based
attention mechanism we intend to reduce the computational load of the exhaustive box proposal mechanism by efficiently finding
regions of interest in the images. This model can be used to efficiently identify trash objects in large waste collection facilities to help
recycling systems. Specifically, we aim at executing a trash detection task using a conventional R-CNN or SSD model and exploring
ways to improve performance using Reinforcement Learning.
