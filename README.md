# Deep Learning Final Project 
Waste Recycling with Improved Object Detection


Large images pose a problem for the conventional object detection techniques. Object detection techniques like R-CNN, SSD are
computationally extensive. They also incur heavy memory and runtime costs for large or densely populated images. This project aims
at improving the conventional R-CNN and SSD algorithms using Reinforcement Learning. Using a Reinforcement Learning based
attention mechanism we intend to reduce the computational load of the exhaustive box proposal mechanism by efficiently finding
regions of interest in the images. This model can be used to efficiently identify trash objects in large waste collection facilities to help
recycling systems.

We have demonstrated the improvement of Reinforcement Learning based
attention mechanism over RCNN based object detection using two notebooks:

Object_Detection_with_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning.ipynb

This repository has one more colab notebook(reference of our previous work in Object Detection as part of Intro To ML Course in Fall, 2020), which details about the state of art models currently used for object detection and also talks about the suitability of these models in various schenarios:
